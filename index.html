        <h2><b>The Journey</b></h2>
        <p>Let's start from the beginning.  I will start from elementary school and bring 
        you to my present LaunchCode LC101 experience.  Ok, pay close attention!</p>
               <header><h3>Elementary School - High School</h3></header>
               <article><p>Growing up I attended three elementary schools in St. Louis, MO.  
                First it was John Marshall which, I attended Kindergarten - 5th grade.  The second
                school was Ralph Waldo Emerson from 6th - 7th grade.  The third school I attended
                was Mark Twain, which I completed the 8th grade. Although I was there
                only for the 8th grade, suprisingly, it was my favorite school.  Oh, yeah, let's not
                forget about my high school.  I attended Northwest High School from my freshman year to 
                my senior year.</p></article>

                <article><p class="mv">Ater high school, I enrolled at Ms. Vanderschmidt's Secretarial
                 School for the clerical program and received a certificate of completion in this 
                 program.  The program consisted of mostly learning how to use a typewriter.  We
                 started with using a manual typewriter, but later advanced to an electric typewriter. 
                 Ms.Vanderschmidt's Secretarial School was the foundation of where I learned how 
                 to type, file and some additional clerical skills.  Yes, I'm on my way now!</p></article>

                <article><p class="ls"> Hallelujah!, now I'm a member at Lively Stone Church of God.  
                 They offered Christian based classes which, included: Survey of the Bible, Teach With Success and You Can Teach Successfully.  
                 Yes, I enrolled in these classes, because I accept opportunities to increase my
                 knowledge. These classes that I took gave me a strong and solid foundation of the Bible. I know you think are we done yet,
                 no not yet, stay with me now!</p></article>

                <article><p class="wu"> I decided that I wanted to pursue my learning in another field. 
                 I wanted to learn more about computers.  I enrolled in Webster University, Watch out 
                 Webster, here I come! I never thought I would be attending a university. I was so excited 
                 that I had gotten this far.  I went to Webster University for four years and received my 
                 Bachelor's of Science Degree with an emphasis in Business.  What a long rode, but I did it! So 
                 now I have completed that era of my life, and now I'm ready for my computer job as a 
                 programmer. Sadly to say, I never got a job as Computer Programmer.</p></article>
